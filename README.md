## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser that supports ES Modules (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
*   (Optional, for development) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm/yarn if you plan to modify the code extensively or set up a local development server with more features.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-chatbot.git
    cd gemini-chatbot
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/gemini-chatbot` with the actual repository URL)

### Running the Application

This application is designed to run directly from the `index.html` file in your browser, thanks to the use of a CDN for Tailwind CSS and `esm.sh` for React and `@google/genai`.

1.  **Open `index.html`:**
    *   Navigate to the project directory in your file explorer.
    *   Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser.

2.  **Using a Local Server (Recommended for Development):**
    For a better development experience (e.g., to avoid potential CORS issues with some browser configurations or for features like hot reloading if you integrate a build system later), you can use a simple HTTP server.
    *   If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx serve`:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```
        This will typically start a server on `http://localhost:3000`.
    *   Alternatively, many code editors like VS Code have extensions (e.g., "Live Server") that can serve the `index.html` file.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch the App:** Open `index.html` in your browser or navigate to the deployed URL.
2.  **Enter API Key:** Upon launching, the chatbot will prompt you to "Enter your Gemini API Key here...".
    *   Paste your Google Gemini API key into the input field.
    *   Press Enter or click the Send button.
3.  **Confirmation:**
    *   If the API key is valid and the client initializes successfully, you'll receive a confirmation message: "Thank you! Your API Key has been set. How can I help you today?"
    *   If there's an issue, an error message will be displayed.
4.  **Chat with Gemini:** Once the API key is set, you can type your messages into the input field and press Enter or click Send to get responses from the AI.
5.  **Features:**
    *   **Copy AI Messages:** Hover over an AI's message bubble to reveal a copy icon. Click it to copy the message text to your clipboard.
    *   **Clear Chat:** Use the "Clear Chat" button in the right sidebar to remove all messages from the current session.
    *   **Toggle Sidebar:** Click the chevron icon in the top-right of the central chat area to show or hide the "Chat Details" sidebar.

## API Key Configuration

The Google Gemini API key is essential for the application to function.

*   **Client-Side Handling:** The API key is entered by the user directly into the application.
*   **Initialization:** The `initializeGeminiClient` function in `services/geminiService.ts` is responsible for taking this key and setting up the `@google/genai` client.
*   **Storage:** The API key is stored in the React component's state (`App.tsx`) for the duration of the session. It is **not** persisted in local storage or cookies by default in this version. Reloading the page will require re-entering the API key.
*   **Security Note:** Since the API key is handled client-side, ensure you are comfortable with this approach for your use case. For applications requiring higher security for a shared API key, a backend proxy would be recommended.

## Deployment

This application, being a static site (HTML, CSS, JS running client-side), can be easily deployed for free on various platforms:

1.  **GitHub Pages:**
    *   Build your React app (if you were using a build system like Create React App or Vite, you'd run `npm run build`). For this current setup, your existing files are already the "build."
    *   Push the project files to a GitHub repository.
    *   In your repository settings, go to "Pages" and configure it to deploy from your `main` branch (usually from the `/` (root) or `/docs` folder).
2.  **Vercel:** Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel. It will typically auto-detect the framework (or you can configure it as a static site) and deploy it.
3.  **Netlify:** Similar to Vercel, connect your Git repository, and Netlify will build and deploy your site.
4.  **Cloudflare Pages:** Offers robust static site hosting with direct Git integration.

For this project in its current state (no build step, direct ESM imports), you can usually just upload the existing files directly to these static hosting providers.

## Customization (For Developers)

*   **Changing AI Model:** The Gemini model is specified in `services/geminiService.ts` (currently `'gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17'`). You can change this to other compatible Gemini models as needed.
*   **Styling:** All styling is done using Tailwind CSS classes directly in the `.tsx` components and `index.html`. You can modify these classes to change the appearance. Consult the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
*   **Adding Features:** Extend components in the `components/` directory or add new ones. Modify state management and API interactions in `App.tsx` and `services/geminiService.ts`.
